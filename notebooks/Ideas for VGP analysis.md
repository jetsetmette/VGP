# 2P data
- Align signal to first lick after pump on

- Classify cells as "nutrient responsive" based on signal going up/down after lick (paried t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test)
- Look at number of cells beeing that are "nutrient responsive" in PR/NR and baseline/ensure/cas/malt/koolaid sessions



# Behavior 
cumulative licks (session)
