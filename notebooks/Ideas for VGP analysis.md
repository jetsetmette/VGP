## Ideas for VGP analysis
- stain VGP cFOS ensure brains for marker for Vgat subpopulation? 
- Flavor conditioning, signal change over sessions? 
- What happens if we switch the flavors?


# 2P data
- Align signal to first lick after pump on

- Classify cells as "nutrient responsive" based on signal going up/down after lick (paried t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test)
- Look at number of cells beeing that are "nutrient responsive" in PR/NR and baseline/ensure/cas/malt/koolaid sessions



# Behavior 
- cumulative licks (session)
- latencty per session flavor conditioning 
- Total licks per session (flavor conditioning )
